# Hand Sign Language Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a Hand Sign Language Recognition system using Machine Learning and image processing techniques. The goal is to enable real-time recognition of hand signs and bridge communication gaps for users of sign language.

## Features

- **Custom Dataset:** Utilizes a diverse dataset containing images of various hand signs.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Implements CNNs for effective feature extraction and image classification.
- **Transfer Learning:** Optimizes model performance using transfer learning techniques.
- **Real-time Recognition:** Incorporates real-time hand sign recognition using a webcam or image input.
- **TensorFlow and OpenCV:** Demonstrates the integration of TensorFlow and OpenCV for image processing.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction and testing.
