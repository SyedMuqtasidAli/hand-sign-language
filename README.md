# hand-sign-language
Creating a Hand Sign Language Recognition project using Machine Learning and image processing techniques. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust feature extraction from hand sign images. It involves extensive use of Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for image processing, model training, and real-time inference.
